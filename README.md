If you had a bunch of good generic classes, would you not place them in a nuget package?<br/>
This library contains essential classes I use in production.<br/>
Cloning and exploring this repository is the recommended way of learning how to use it. It is not meant for the juniors.

### Installation
```sh
PM> Install-Package Nucs.Essentials
```
